    RANDOMNESS
        stunnel needs to seed the PRNG (pseudo-random number generator) in order
        for  TLS  to  use  good randomness.  The following sources are loaded in
        order until sufficient random data has been gathered:
 
        o   The file specified with the RNDfile flag.
 
        o   The file specified by the RANDFILE environment variable, if set.
 
        o   The file .rnd in your home directory, if RANDFILE not set.
 
        o   The file specified with '--with-random' at compile time.
 
        o   The contents of the screen if running on Windows.
 
        o   The egd socket specified with the EGD flag.
 
        o   The egd socket specified with '--with-egd-sock' at compile time.
 
        o   The /dev/urandom device.
 
        Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user  interaction
        (mouse  movements,  creating  windows, etc.) the screen contents are not
        variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a  random  file
        for use with the RNDfile flag.
 
        Note that the file specified with the RNDfile flag should contain random
        data  --  that  means  it should contain different information each time
        stunnel is run.  This is handled automatically unless  the  RNDoverwrite
        flag  is  used.   If  you wish to update this file manually, the openssl
        rand command in recent versions of OpenSSL, would be useful.
 
        Important note: If /dev/urandom is available, OpenSSL  often  seeds  the
        PRNG  with  it  while  checking  the  random  state.   On  systems  with
        /dev/urandom OpenSSL is likely to use it even though it is listed at the
        very bottom of the list above.  This is the behaviour of OpenSSL and not
        stunnel.
 
    DH PARAMETERS
        stunnel 4.40  and  later  contains  hardcoded  2048-bit  DH  parameters.
        Starting  with  stunnel 5.18, these hardcoded DH parameters are replaced
        every 24 hours with autogenerated temporary DH parameters.  DH parameter
        generation may take several minutes.
 
        Alternatively, it is possible to specify static  DH  parameters  in  the
        certificate file, which disables generating temporary DH parameters:
 
            openssl dhparam 2048 >> stunnel.pem
 
 FILES

 BUGS
        The execArgs option and the Win32 command line do not support quoting.

 NAME
        stunnel - TLS offloading and load-balancing proxy
 
 SYNOPSIS
        Unix:
            stunnel [FILE] | -fd N | -help | -version | -sockets | -options
 
        WIN32:
            stunnel [ [ -install | -uninstall | -start | -stop |
                -reload | -reopen | -exit ] [-quiet] [FILE] ] |
                -help | -version | -sockets | -options
 
 DESCRIPTION
        The  stunnel  program  is  designed  to  work  as TLS encryption wrapper
        between remote clients and local (inetd-startable)  or  remote  servers.
        The  concept is that having non-TLS aware daemons running on your system
        you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over  secure  TLS
        channels.
 
        stunnel  can  be  used  to  add TLS functionality to commonly used Inetd
        daemons like POP-2, POP-3, and IMAP servers, to standalone daemons  like
        NNTP,  SMTP  and HTTP, and in tunneling PPP over network sockets without
        changes to the source code.
 
        This product includes  cryptographic  software  written  by  Eric  Young
        (eay@cryptsoft.com)

 CONFIGURATION FILE
        Each line of the configuration file can be either:
 
        o   An empty line (ignored).
 
        o   A comment starting with ';' (ignored).
 
        o   An 'option_name = option_value' pair.
 
        o   '[service_name]' indicating a start of a service definition.
 
        An address parameter of an option may be either:
 
        o   A port number.
 
        o   A  colon-separated  pair of IP address (either IPv4, IPv6, or domain
            name) and port number.
 
        o   A Unix socket path (Unix only).
 
    GLOBAL OPTIONS
        chroot = DIRECTORY (Unix only)
            directory to chroot stunnel process
 
            chroot keeps stunnel in a chrooted jail.  CApath, CRLpath,  pid  and
            exec are located inside the jail and the patches have to be relative
            to the directory specified with chroot.
 
            Several  functions  of the operating system also need their files to
            be located within the chroot jail, e.g.:
 
            o   Delayed  resolver   typically   needs   /etc/nsswitch.conf   and
                /etc/resolv.conf.
 
            o   Local time in log files needs /etc/timezone.
 
            o   Some  other  functions  may  need  devices,  e.g.  /dev/zero  or
                /dev/null.
 
        compression = deflate | zlib
            select data compression algorithm
 
            default: no compression
 
            Deflate is the standard compression method as described in RFC 1951.
 
        debug = [FACILITY.]LEVEL
            debugging level
 
            Level is one of the syslog level names or numbers emerg  (0),  alert
            (1),  crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5), info (6), or debug
            (7).  All logs for the specified level and  all  levels  numerically
            less than it will be shown.
 
            The debug = debug (or the equivalent <debug = 7>) level produces for
            the most verbose log output.  This logging level is only meant to be
            understood  by  stunnel developers, and not by users.  Please either
            use the debug level when requested to do so by an stunnel developer,
            or when you intend to get confused.
 
            The default logging level is notice (5).
 
            The syslog 'daemon' facility will be used unless a facility name  is
            supplied.  (Facilities are not supported on Win32.)
 
            Case is ignored for both facilities and levels.
 
        EGD = EGD_PATH (Unix only)
            path to Entropy Gathering Daemon socket
 
            Entropy  Gathering  Daemon  socket to use to feed the OpenSSL random
            number generator.
 
        engine = auto | ENGINE_ID
            select hardware or software cryptographic engine
 
            default: software-only cryptography
 
            See  Examples  section  for  an  engine  configuration  to  use  the
            certificate  and  the corresponding private key from a cryptographic
            device.
 
        engineCtrl = COMMAND[:PARAMETER]
            control hardware engine
 
        engineDefault = TASK_LIST
            set OpenSSL tasks delegated to the current engine
 
            The parameter  specifies  a  comma-separated  list  of  task  to  be
            delegated to the current engine.
 
            The  following  tasks  may be available, if supported by the engine:
            ALL, RSA, DSA,  ECDH,  ECDSA,  DH,  RAND,  CIPHERS,  DIGESTS,  PKEY,
            PKEY_CRYPTO, PKEY_ASN1.
 
        fips = yes | no
            enable or disable FIPS 140-2 mode.
 
            This  option allows you to disable entering FIPS mode if stunnel was
            compiled with FIPS 140-2 support.
 
            default: no (since version 5.00)
 
        foreground = yes | quiet | no (Unix only)
            foreground mode
 
            Stay in foreground (don't fork).
 
            With the yes parameter it also logs to stderr  in  addition  to  the
            destinations specified with syslog and output.
 
            default: background in daemon mode
 
        iconActive = ICON_FILE (GUI only)
            GUI icon to be displayed when there are established connections
 
            On  Windows platform the parameter should be an .ico file containing
            a 16x16 pixel image.
 
        iconError = ICON_FILE (GUI only)
            GUI icon to be displayed when no valid configuration is loaded
 
            On Windows platform the parameter should be an .ico file  containing
            a 16x16 pixel image.
 
        iconIdle = ICON_FILE (GUI only)
            GUI icon to be displayed when there are no established connections
 
            On  Windows platform the parameter should be an .ico file containing
            a 16x16 pixel image.
 
        log = append | overwrite
            log file handling
 
            This option allows you to choose whether  the  log  file  (specified
            with  the  output  option) is appended or overwritten when opened or
            re-opened.
 
            default: append
 
        output = FILE
            append log messages to a file
 
            /dev/stdout device can be used to send log messages to the  standard
            output (for example to log them with daemontools splogger).
 
        pid = FILE (Unix only)
            pid file location
 
            If the argument is empty, then no pid file will be created.
 
            pid path is relative to the chroot directory if specified.
 
        provider = PROVIDER_ID
            Specifies the identifier of the provider to be used.  PROVIDER_ID is
            a  unique  identifier  referring to a specific cryptographic service
            provider.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 3.0 or later.
 
        providerParameter = PROVIDER_ID:PARAMETER=VALUE
            Sets a specific  parameter  for  the  given  provider.   PROVIDER_ID
            identifies  the provider, PARAMETER is the parameter name, and VALUE
            is its value. This  option  allows  customization  of  the  selected
            cryptographic service provider's configuration.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 3.5 or later.
 
        RNDbytes = BYTES
            bytes to read from random seed files
 
        RNDfile = FILE
            path to file with random seed data
 
            The  OpenSSL  library will use data from this file first to seed the
            random number generator.
 
        RNDoverwrite = yes | no
            overwrite the random seed files with new random data
 
            default: yes
 
        service = SERVICE (Unix only)
            stunnel service name
 
            The specified service name is used for syslog and as the inetd  mode
            service name for TCP Wrappers.  While this option can technically be
            specified  in  the  service  sections,  it  is only useful in global
            options.
 
            default: stunnel
 
        setEnv = VAR_NAME=VALUE
            Change or add an  environment  variable  for  child  processes.   If
            VAR_NAME already exists, its value will be updated; otherwise, a new
            variable  will be created. This modification applies only to spawned
            child processes and does not affect the current environment.
 
        syslog = yes | no (Unix only)
            enable logging via syslog
 
            default: yes
 
        taskbar = yes | no (WIN32 only)
            enable the taskbar icon
 
            default: yes
 
    SERVICE-LEVEL OPTIONS
        Each  configuration  section  begins  with  a  service  name  in  square
        brackets.   The  service  name is used for libwrap (TCP Wrappers) access
        control and lets you distinguish stunnel services in your log files.
 
        Note that if you wish to run stunnel in inetd mode (where it is provided
        a network socket by a server such as inetd, xinetd, or  tcpserver)  then
        you should read the section entitled INETD MODE below.
 
        accept = [HOST:]PORT
            accept connections on specified address
 
            If  no  host specified, defaults to all IPv4 addresses for the local
            host.
 
            To listen on all IPv6 addresses use:
 
                accept = :::PORT
 
        CAengine = ENGINE-SPECIFIC_CA_CERTIFICATE_IDENTIFIER
            load a trusted CA certificate from an engine
 
            The loaded CA certificates will be used  with  the  verifyChain  and
            verifyPeer options.
 
            Multiple CAengine options are allowed in a single service section.
 
            Currently supported engines: pkcs11, cng.
 
        CApath = CA_DIRECTORY
            load trusted CA certificates from a directory
 
            The  loaded  CA  certificates  will be used with the verifyChain and
            verifyPeer options.  Note that the certificates  in  this  directory
            should  be  named XXXXXXXX.0 where XXXXXXXX is the hash value of the
            DER encoded subject of the cert.
 
            This parameter can also be used to provide the root  CA  certificate
            needed to validate OCSP stapling in server mode.
 
            The  hash  algorithm  has  been  changed  in  OpenSSL  1.0.0.  It is
            required to c_rehash the directory on upgrade from OpenSSL 0.x.x  to
            OpenSSL 1.x.x or later.
 
            CApath path is relative to the chroot directory if specified.
 
        CAfile = CA_FILE
            load trusted CA certificates from a file
 
            The  loaded  CA  certificates  will be used with the verifyChain and
            verifyPeer options.
 
            This parameter can also be used to provide the root  CA  certificate
            needed to validate OCSP stapling in server mode.
 
        CAstore = URI_CA
            load trusted CA certificates from a resource specified by a URI
 
            This  option  allows loading CA certificates from an external source
            supported by the OSSL_STORE framework,  such  as  a  PKCS#11  module
            (e.g.,  hardware  token),  the system certificate store, or a remote
            resource.
 
            This option can be used  independently  of  CAfile  and  CAdir,  and
            similarly  provides  certificates used by verifyChain or verifyPeer,
            as well as for validating OCSP stapling in server mode.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 3.0 or later.
 
        cert = CERT_FILE | URI
            certificate chain file name
 
            The parameter specifies the file  containing  certificates  used  by
            stunnel  to authenticate itself against the remote client or server.
            The file should contain the whole certificate  chain  starting  from
            the  actual  server/client  certificate,  and  ending with the self-
            signed root CA certificate.  The file must be either in PEM  or  P12
            format.
 
            A  certificate  chain  is  required  in server mode, and optional in
            client mode.
 
            The  cert  option  may  be  specified  multiple  times.  The   first
            certificate encountered is used as the server or client certificate,
            while  any subsequent certificates are treated as intermediate chain
            elements. This  functionality  requires  OpenSSL  version  1.0.2  or
            later.
 
            This  parameter  is also used as the certificate identifier (PKCS#11
            URI) when a hardware engine or provider is enabled.
 
            Note: The provider requires OpenSSL 3.0 or later
 
        checkEmail = EMAIL
            verify the email address of the end-entity (leaf)  peer  certificate
            subject
 
            Certificates  are  accepted  if no subject checks were specified, or
            the email address of the end-entity (leaf) peer certificate  matches
            any of the email addresses specified with checkEmail.
 
            Multiple checkEmail options are allowed in a single service section.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.
 
        checkHost = HOST
            verify the host of the end-entity (leaf) peer certificate subject
 
            Certificates  are  accepted  if no subject checks were specified, or
            the host name of the end-entity (leaf) peer certificate matches  any
            of the hosts specified with checkHost.
 
            Multiple checkHost options are allowed in a single service section.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.
 
        checkIP = IP
            verify  the  IP  address  of  the end-entity (leaf) peer certificate
            subject
 
            Certificates are accepted if no subject checks  were  specified,  or
            the IP address of the end-entity (leaf) peer certificate matches any
            of the IP addresses specified with checkIP.
 
            Multiple checkIP options are allowed in a single service section.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.
 
        ciphers = CIPHER_LIST
            select permitted TLS ciphers (TLSv1.2 and below)
 
            This option does not impact TLSv1.3 ciphersuites.
 
            A   colon-delimited  list  of  the  ciphers  to  allow  in  the  TLS
            connection, for example DES-CBC3-SHA:IDEA-CBC-MD5.
 
        ciphersuites = CIPHERSUITES_LIST
            select permitted TLSv1.3 ciphersuites
 
            A colon-delimited list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuites  names  in  order  of
            preference.
 
            The  ciphersuites  option ignores unknown ciphers when compiled with
            OpenSSL 3.0 or later.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later.
 
            default:
            TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 
        client = yes | no
            client mode (remote service uses TLS)
 
            default: no (server mode)
 
        config = COMMAND[:PARAMETER]
            OpenSSL configuration command
 
            The OpenSSL configuration command is  executed  with  the  specified
            parameter.   This  allows  any  configuration commands to be invoked
            from  the  stunnel  configuration  file.   Supported  commands   are
            described on the SSL_CONF_cmd(3ssl) manual page.
 
            Several  config  lines can be used to specify multiple configuration
            commands.
 
            Use curves option instead of enabling config = Curves:list_curves to
            support elliptic curves.
 
            This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.
 
        connect = [HOST:]PORT
            connect to a remote address
 
            If no host is specified, the host defaults to localhost.
 
            Multiple connect options are allowed in a  single  service  section.
            If  host  resolves  to multiple addresses and/or if multiple connect
            options are specified, then the remote address  is  chosen  using  a
            round-robin algorithm.
 
        CRLpath = DIRECTORY
            Certificate Revocation Lists directory
 
            This is the directory in which stunnel will look for CRLs when using
            the  verifyChain  and verifyPeer options. Note that the CRLs in this
            directory should be named XXXXXXXX.r0 where  XXXXXXXX  is  the  hash
            value of the CRL.
 
            The  hash  algorithm  has  been  changed  in  OpenSSL  1.0.0.  It is
            required to c_rehash the directory on upgrade from OpenSSL 0.x.x  to
            OpenSSL 1.x.x.
 
            CRLpath path is relative to the chroot directory if specified.
 
        CRLfile = CRL_FILE
            Certificate Revocation Lists file
 
            This  file  contains  multiple  CRLs,  used with the verifyChain and
            verifyPeer options.
 
        curves = list
            ECDH curves separated with ':'
 
            Only a single curve name is allowed for OpenSSL older than 1.1.1.
 
            To get a list of supported curves use:
 
                openssl ecparam -list_curves
 
            default:
 
                X25519:P-256:X448:P-521:P-384 (OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later)
 
                prime256v1 (OpenSSL older than 1.1.1)
 
        logId = TYPE
            connection identifier type
 
            This identifier allows you to distinguish log entries generated  for
            each of the connections.
 
            Currently supported types:
 
            sequential
                The numeric sequential identifier is only unique within a single
                instance  of  stunnel,  but very compact.  It is most useful for
                manual log analysis.
 
            unique
                This alphanumeric identifier is globally unique, but longer than
                the sequential number.  It is  most  useful  for  automated  log
                analysis.
 
            thread
                The  operating  system thread identifier is neither unique (even
                within a single instance of stunnel)  nor  short.   It  is  most
                useful for debugging software or configuration issues.
 
            process
                The  operating  system process identifier (PID) may be useful in
                the inetd mode.
 
            default: sequential
 
        debug = LEVEL
            debugging level
 
            Level is a one of the syslog level names or numbers emerg (0), alert
            (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5), info (6), or  debug
            (7).   All  logs  for the specified level and all levels numerically
            less than it will be shown.  The default is notice (5).
 
            While the debug = debug or  debug  =  7  level  generates  the  most
            verbose   output,  it  is  only  intended  to  be  used  by  stunnel
            developers.  Please only use this value if you are a  developer,  or
            you  intend  to send your logs to our technical support.  Otherwise,
            the generated logs will be confusing.
 
        delay = yes | no
            delay DNS lookup for the connect option
 
            This option is useful for dynamic DNS, or when DNS is not  available
            during stunnel startup (road warrior VPN, dial-up configurations).
 
            Delayed resolver mode is automatically engaged when stunnel fails to
            resolve on startup any of the connect targets for a service.
 
            Delayed resolver inflicts failover = prio.
 
            default: no
 
        engineId = ENGINE_ID
            select engine ID for the service
 
        engineNum = ENGINE_NUMBER
            select engine number for the service
 
            The engines are numbered starting from 1.
 
        exec = EXECUTABLE_PATH
            execute a local inetd-type program
 
            exec path is relative to the chroot directory if specified.
 
            The  following  environmental  variables  are set on Unix platforms:
            REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT, SSL_CLIENT_DN, SSL_CLIENT_I_DN.
 
        execArgs = $0 $1 $2 ...
            arguments for exec including the program name ($0)
 
            Quoting is currently not supported.  Arguments are separated with an
            arbitrary amount of whitespace.
 
        failover = rr | prio
            Failover strategy for multiple "connect" targets.
 
            rr  round robin - fair load distribution
 
            prio
                priority - use the order specified in config file
 
            default: prio
 
        ident = USERNAME
            use IDENT (RFC 1413) username checking
 
        include = DIRECTORY
            include all configuration file parts located in DIRECTORY
 
            The files are included in the ascending alphabetical order of  their
            names. The recommended filename convention is
 
            for global options:
 
                    00-global.conf
 
            for local service-level options:
 
                    01-service.conf
 
                    02-service.conf
 
        key = KEY_FILE | URI
            private key for the certificate specified with cert option
 
            A  private  key  is  needed  to  authenticate the certificate owner.
            Since this file should be kept secret it should only be readable  by
            its owner.  On Unix systems you can use the following command:
 
                chmod 600 keyfile
 
            This  parameter  is also used as the private key identifier (PKCS#11
            URI) when a hardware engine or provider is enabled.
 
            Note: The provider requires OpenSSL 3.0 or later
 
            default: the value of the cert option
 
        libwrap = yes | no
            Enable or disable the use of /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.
 
            default: no (since version 5.00)
 
        local = HOST
            By default, the IP address of the outgoing interface is used as  the
            source  for  remote  connections.   Use this option to bind a static
            local IP address instead.
 
        OCSP = URL
            select OCSP responder for the  end-entity  (leaf)  peer  certificate
            verification
 
        OCSPaia = yes | no
            validate certificates with their AIA OCSP responders
 
            This  option  enables stunnel to validate certificates with the list
            of  OCSP  responder  URLs  retrieved  from  their   AIA   (Authority
            Information Access) extension.
 
        OCSPflag = OCSP_FLAG
            specify OCSP responder flag
 
            Several OCSPflag can be used to specify multiple flags.
 
            currently  supported  flags:  NOCERTS,  NOINTERN,  NOSIGS,  NOCHAIN,
            NOVERIFY, NOEXPLICIT, NOCASIGN, NODELEGATED,  NOCHECKS,  TRUSTOTHER,
            RESPID_KEY, NOTIME
 
        OCSPnonce = yes | no
            send and verify the OCSP nonce extension
 
            This  option protects the OCSP protocol against replay attacks.  Due
            to its computational overhead, the nonce extension is  usually  only
            supported on internal (e.g. corporate) responders, and not on public
            OCSP responders.
 
        OCSPrequire = yes | no
            require a conclusive OCSP response
 
            Disable  this option to allow a connection even though no conclusive
            OCSP response was retrieved from stapling and a  direct  request  to
            the OCSP responder.
 
            default: yes
 
        options = SSL_OPTIONS
            OpenSSL library options
 
            The  parameter  is  the  OpenSSL  option  name  as  described in the
            SSL_CTX_set_options(3ssl)  manual,  but  without   SSL_OP_   prefix.
            stunnel  -options  lists  the  options  found  to  be allowed in the
            current combination of stunnel and the OpenSSL library used to build
            it.
 
            Several option lines can be used to specify  multiple  options.   An
            option  name  can  be  prepended  with  a  dash ("-") to disable the
            option.
 
            For  example,  for  compatibility  with  the  erroneous  Eudora  TLS
            implementation, the following option can be used:
 
                options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
 
            default:
 
                options = NO_SSLv2
                options = NO_SSLv3
 
            Use  sslVersionMax  or  sslVersionMin  option  instead  of disabling
            specific TLS protocol versions when compiled with OpenSSL  1.1.0  or
            later.
 
        protocol = PROTO
            application protocol to negotiate TLS
 
            This  option  enables  initial, protocol-specific negotiation of the
            TLS encryption.  The protocol option should not  be  used  with  TLS
            encryption on a separate port.
 
            Currently supported protocols:
 
            cifs
                Proprietary    (undocumented)   extension   of   CIFS   protocol

                USERID parameter is ignored.
 
                See Examples section for  sample  configuration  files  for  VPN
                based on SOCKS encryption.
 
        protocolAuthentication = AUTHENTICATION
            authentication type for the protocol negotiations
 
            Currently,   this  option  is  only  supported  in  the  client-side
            'connect' and 'smtp' protocols.
 
            Supported  authentication  types  for  the  'connect'  protocol  are
            'basic'  or  'ntlm'.   The  default 'connect' authentication type is
            'basic'.
 
            Supported authentication types for the 'smtp' protocol  are  'plain'
            or 'login'.  The default 'smtp' authentication type is 'plain'.
 
        protocolDomain = DOMAIN
            domain for the protocol negotiations
 
            Currently,   this  option  is  only  supported  in  the  client-side
            'connect' protocol.
 
        protocolHeader = HEADER
            header for the protocol negotiations
 
            Currently,  this  option  is  only  supported  in  the   client-side
            'connect' protocol.
 
        protocolHost = ADDRESS
            host address for the protocol negotiations
 
            For  the  'connect'  protocol  negotiations,  protocolHost specifies
            HOST:PORT of the final TLS server to be connected to by  the  proxy.
            The  proxy  server  directly  connected by stunnel must be specified
            with the connect option.
 
            For the 'smtp'  protocol  negotiations,  protocolHost  controls  the
            client SMTP HELO/EHLO value.
 
        protocolPassword = PASSWORD
            password for the protocol negotiations
 
            Currently,   this  option  is  only  supported  in  the  client-side
            'connect' and 'smtp' protocols.
 
        protocolUsername = USERNAME
            username for the protocol negotiations
 
            Currently,  this  option  is  only  supported  in  the   client-side
            'connect' and 'smtp' protocols.
 
        PSKidentity = IDENTITY
            PSK identity for the PSK client
 
            PSKidentity  can  be  used  on  stunnel  clients  to  select the PSK
            identity used for authentication.  This option is ignored in  server
            sections.
 
            default: the first identity specified in the PSKsecrets file.
 
        PSKsecrets = FILE
            file with PSK identities and corresponding keys
 
            Each line of the file in the following format:
 
                IDENTITY:KEY
 
            Hexadecimal  keys  are automatically converted to binary form.  Keys
            are required to be at least 16 bytes long, which implies at least 32
            characters for hexadecimal keys.  The file should neither be  world-
            readable nor world-writable.
 
        pty = yes | no (Unix only)
            allocate a pseudoterminal for 'exec' option
 
        redirect = [HOST:]PORT
            redirect  TLS client connections on certificate-based authentication
            failures
 
            This option only works in server mode.  Some  protocol  negotiations
            are also incompatible with the redirect option.
 
        renegotiation = yes | no
            support TLS renegotiation
 
            Applications  of  the  TLS renegotiation include some authentication
            scenarios, or re-keying long lasting connections.
 
            On the other  hand  this  feature  can  facilitate  a  trivial  CPU-
            exhaustion DoS attack:
 
            http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-dos-mitigation.html
 
            Please note that disabling TLS renegotiation does not fully mitigate
            this issue.
 
            default: yes (if supported by OpenSSL)
 
        reset = yes | no
            attempt to use the TCP RST flag to indicate an error
 
            This option is not supported on some platforms.
 
            default: yes
 
        retry = yes | no | DELAY
            reconnect a connect+exec section after it was disconnected
 
            The   DELAY  value  specifies  the  number  of  milliseconds  before
            retrying.  "retry = yes" has the same effect as "retry = 1000".
 
            default: no
 
        securityLevel = LEVEL
            set the security level
 
            The meaning of each level is described below:
 
            level 0
                Everything is permitted.
 
            level 1
                The security level corresponds  to  a  minimum  of  80  bits  of
                security.  Any parameters offering below 80 bits of security are
                excluded. As a result RSA, DSA and DH  keys  shorter  than  1024
                bits  and  ECC  keys  shorter  than 160 bits are prohibited. All
                export cipher suites are prohibited since they  all  offer  less
                than  80  bits  of  security.  SSL  version 2 is prohibited. Any
                cipher  suite  using  MD5  for  the  MAC  is  also   prohibited.
                Additionally,  SSLv3,  TLS  1.0,  TLS  1.1  are all disabled for
                OpenSSL 3.0 and later.
 
            level 2
                Security level set to 112 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA
                and DH keys shorter than 2048 bits and ECC keys shorter than 224
                bits are prohibited. In addition to the level 1  exclusions  any
                cipher  suite  using  RC4  is  also  prohibited.  Compression is
                disabled. SSL version 3 is also not allowed  for  OpenSSL  older
                than 3.0.
 
            level 3
                Security level set to 128 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA
                and DH keys shorter than 3072 bits and ECC keys shorter than 256
                bits  are  prohibited.  In  addition  to  the level 2 exclusions
                cipher suites  not  offering  forward  secrecy  are  prohibited.
                Session  tickets  are  disabled.  TLS versions below 1.1 are not
                permitted for OpenSSL older than 3.0.
 
            level 4
                Security level set to 192 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA
                and DH keys shorter than 7680 bits and ECC keys shorter than 384
                bits are prohibited.  Cipher suites using SHA1 for the  MAC  are
                prohibited. TLS versions below 1.2 are not permitted for OpenSSL
                older than 3.0.
 
            level 5
                Security level set to 256 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA
                and  DH  keys  shorter than 15360 bits and ECC keys shorter than
                512 bits are prohibited.
 
            default: 2
 
            The securityLevel  option  is  only  available  when  compiled  with
            OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later.
 
        requireCert = yes | no
            require a client certificate for verifyChain or verifyPeer
 
            With  requireCert  set  to  no,  the  stunnel  server accepts client
            connections that did not present a certificate.
 
            Both verifyChain = yes and verifyPeer = yes imply requireCert = yes.
 
            default: no
 
        setgid = GROUP (Unix only)
            Unix group id
 
            As a global option: setgid() to the specified group in  daemon  mode
            and clear all other groups.
 
            As  a  service-level  option:  set  the  group  of  the  Unix socket
            specified with "accept".
 
        setuid = USER (Unix only)
            Unix user id
 
            As a global option: setuid() to the specified user in daemon mode.
 
            As a  service-level  option:  set  the  owner  of  the  Unix  socket
            specified with "accept".
 
        sessionCacheSize = NUM_ENTRIES
            session cache size
 
            sessionCacheSize  specifies  the  maximum  number  of  the  internal
            session cache entries.
 
            The value  of  0  can  be  used  for  unlimited  size.   It  is  not
            recommended  for  production  use  due  to  the  risk  of  a  memory
            exhaustion DoS attack.
 
        sessionCacheTimeout = TIMEOUT
            session cache timeout
 
            This is the number of seconds to keep cached TLS sessions.
 
        sessionResume = yes | no
            allow or disallow session resumption
 
            default: yes
 
        sessiond = HOST:PORT
            address of sessiond TLS cache server
 
        sni = SERVICE_NAME:SERVER_NAME_PATTERN (server mode)
            Use the service as a secondary service (a name-based virtual server)
            for Server Name Indication TLS extension (RFC 3546).
 
            SERVICE_NAME specifies  the  primary  service  that  accepts  client
            connections  with  the accept option.  SERVER_NAME_PATTERN specifies
            the host name to be redirected.  The pattern may start with the  '*'
            character,  e.g.   '*.example.com'.  Multiple secondary services are
            normally specified for a single primary service.  The sni option can
            also be specified more than once within a single secondary service.
 
            This service, as well as the primary service, may not be  configured
            in client mode.
 
            The  connect  option  of  the  secondary service is ignored when the
            protocol option is specified, as protocol  connects  to  the  remote
            host before TLS handshake.
 
            Libwrap  checks  (Unix  only)  are performed twice: with the primary
            service  name  after  TCP  connection  is  accepted,  and  with  the
            secondary service name during the TLS handshake.
 
            The  sni  option  is only available when compiled with OpenSSL 1.0.0
            and later.
 
        sni = SERVER_NAME (client mode)
            Use the parameter as the value of TLS Server  Name  Indication  (RFC
            3546) extension.
 
            Empty SERVER_NAME disables sending the SNI extension.
 
            The  sni  option  is only available when compiled with OpenSSL 1.0.0
            and later.
 
        socket = a|l|r:OPTION=VALUE[:VALUE]
            Set an option on the accept/local/remote socket
 
            The values for the linger option are  l_onof:l_linger.   The  values
            for the time are tv_sec:tv_usec.
 
            Examples:
 
                socket = l:SO_LINGER=1:60
                    set one minute timeout for closing local socket
                socket = r:SO_OOBINLINE=yes
                    place out-of-band data directly into the
                    receive data stream for remote sockets
                socket = a:SO_REUSEADDR=no
                    disable address reuse (enabled by default)
                socket = a:SO_BINDTODEVICE=lo
                    only accept connections on loopback interface
 
        sslVersion = SSL_VERSION
            select the TLS protocol version
 
            Supported  versions:  all,  SSLv2,  SSLv3,  TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2,
            TLSv1.3
 
            Availability of specific protocols depends  on  the  linked  OpenSSL
            library.   Older versions of OpenSSL do not support TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2
            and TLSv1.3.  Newer versions of OpenSSL do not support SSLv2.
 
            Obsolete SSLv2 and SSLv3 are currently disabled by default.
 
            Setting the option
 
                sslVersion = SSL_VERSION
 
            is equivalent to options
 
                sslVersionMax = SSL_VERSION
                sslVersionMin = SSL_VERSION
 
            when compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later.
 
        sslVersionMax = SSL_VERSION
            maximum supported protocol versions
 
            Supported versions: all, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
 
            all enable protocol versions up to the highest version supported  by
            the linked OpenSSL library.
 
            Availability  of  specific  protocols  depends on the linked OpenSSL
            library.
 
            The sslVersionMax  option  is  only  available  when  compiled  with
            OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later.
 
            default: all
 
        sslVersionMin = SSL_VERSION
            minimum supported protocol versions
 
            Supported versions: all, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
 
            all enable protocol versions down to the lowest version supported by
            the linked OpenSSL library.
 
            Availability  of  specific  protocols  depends on the linked OpenSSL
            library.
 
            The sslVersionMin  option  is  only  available  when  compiled  with
            OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later.
 
            default: TLSv1
 
        stack = BYTES (except for FORK model)
            CPU stack size of created threads
 
            Excessive   thread   stack  size  increases  virtual  memory  usage.
            Insufficient thread stack size may cause application crashes.
 
            default: 65536 bytes (sufficient for all platforms we tested)
 
        ticketKeySecret = SECRET
            hexadecimal symmetric key used for  session  ticket  confidentiality
            protection
 
            Session  tickets  defined  in  RFC  5077 provide an enhanced session
            resumption capability, where the server-side caching is not required
            to maintain per session state.
 
            Combining  ticketKeySecret  and  ticketMacSecret  options  allow  to
            resume  a  negotiated session on other cluster nodes, or to resume a
            negotiated session after server restart.
 
            The key is required to be either 16 or 32 bytes long, which  implies
            exactly  32 or 64 hexadecimal digits.  Colons may optionally be used
            between two-character hexadecimal bytes.
 
            This option only works in server mode.
 
            The ticketKeySecret option is  only  available  when  compiled  with
            OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later.
 
            Disabling  NO_TICKET  option  is  required for the ticket support in
            OpenSSL older than 1.1.1, but note that this option is  incompatible
            with the redirect option.
 
        ticketMacSecret = SECRET
            hexadecimal   symmetric   key  used  for  session  ticket  integrity
            protection
 
            The key is required to be either 16 or 32 bytes long, which  implies
            exactly  32 or 64 hexadecimal digits.  Colons may optionally be used
            between two-character hexadecimal bytes.
 
            This option only works in server mode.
 
            The ticketMacSecret option is  only  available  when  compiled  with
            OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later.
 
        TIMEOUTbusy = SECONDS
            time to wait for expected data
 
        TIMEOUTclose = SECONDS
            time to wait for close_notify (set to 0 for buggy MSIE)
 
        TIMEOUTconnect = SECONDS
            time to wait to connect a remote host
 
        TIMEOUTidle = SECONDS
            time to keep an idle connection
 
        TIMEOUTocsp = SECONDS
            time to wait to connect an OCSP responder
 
        transparent = none | source | destination | both (Unix only)
            enable transparent proxy support on selected platforms
 
            Supported values:
 
            none
                Disable transparent proxy support.  This is the default.
 
            source
                Re-write  the  address  to  appear  as  if  a  wrapped daemon is
                connecting from the TLS client machine instead  of  the  machine
                running stunnel.
 
                This option is currently available in:
 
                Remote mode (connect option) on Linux >=2.6.28
                    This  configuration  requires stunnel to be executed as root
                    and without the setuid option.
 
                    This configuration requires the following setup for iptables
                    and routing (possibly in /etc/rc.local or equivalent file):
 
                        iptables -t mangle -N DIVERT
                        iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m socket -j DIVERT
                        iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j MARK --set-mark 1
                        iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j ACCEPT
                        ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100
                        ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100
                        echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/rp_filter
 
                    stunnel must also to be executed as  root  and  without  the
                    setuid option.
 
                Remote mode (connect option) on Linux 2.2.x
                    This  configuration  requires the kernel to be compiled with
                    the transparent proxy option.   Connected  service  must  be
                    installed  on  a separate host.  Routing towards the clients
                    has to go through the stunnel box.
 
                    stunnel must also to be executed as  root  and  without  the
                    setuid option.
 
                Remote mode (connect option) on FreeBSD >=8.0
                    This  configuration requires additional firewall and routing
                    setup.  stunnel must also to be executed as root and without
                    the setuid option.
 
                Local mode (exec option)
                    This configuration works by  pre-loading  the  libstunnel.so
                    shared  library.   _RLD_LIST environment variable is used on
                    Tru64, and LD_PRELOAD variable on other platforms.
 
            destination
                The original destination is used instead of the connect option.
 
                A service section for  transparent  destination  may  look  like
                this:
 
                    [transparent]
                    client = yes
                    accept = <stunnel_port>
                    transparent = destination
 
                This  configuration requires iptables setup to work, possibly in
                /etc/rc.local or equivalent file.
 
                For a connect target installed on the same host:
 
                    /sbin/iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport <redirected_port> \
                        -m ! --uid-owner <stunnel_user_id> \
                        -j DNAT --to-destination <local_ip>:<stunnel_port>
 
                For a connect target installed on a remote host:
 
                    /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport <stunnel_port> -j ACCEPT
                    /sbin/iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <redirected_port> \
                        -i eth0 -j DNAT --to-destination <local_ip>:<stunnel_port>
 
                The transparent destination option is currently  only  supported
                on Linux.
 
            both
                Use both source and destination transparent proxy.
 
            Two legacy options are also supported for backward compatibility:
 
            yes This option has been renamed to source.
 
            no  This option has been renamed to none.
 
        verify = LEVEL
            verify the peer certificate
 
            This  option is obsolete and should be replaced with the verifyChain
            and verifyPeer options.
 
            level 0
                Request and ignore the peer certificate chain.
 
            level 1
                Verify the peer certificate chain if present.
 
            level 2
                Verify the peer certificate chain.
 
            level 3
                Verify the peer certificate chain and the end-entity (leaf) peer
                certificate against a locally installed certificate.
 
            level 4
                Ignore the peer certificate chain and only verify the end-entity
                (leaf) peer certificate against a locally installed certificate.
 
            default
                No verify.
 
        verifyChain = yes | no
            verify the peer certificate chain starting from the root CA
 
            For server certificate verification it is essential to also  require
            a specific certificate with checkHost or checkIP.
 
            The self-signed root CA certificate needs to be stored either in the
            file  specified  with  CAfile,  or  in  the directory specified with
            CApath.
 
            default: no
 
        verifyPeer = yes | no
            verify the end-entity (leaf) peer certificate
 
            The end-entity (leaf) peer certificate needs to be stored either  in
            the  file  specified with CAfile, or in the directory specified with
            CApath.
 
            default: no
 
 RETURN VALUE
        stunnel returns zero on success, non-zero on error.
 
 SIGNALS
        The  following  signals  can  be  used  to  control  stunnel   in   Unix
        environment:
 
        SIGHUP
            Force a reload of the configuration file.
 
            Some global options will not be reloaded:
 
            o   chroot
 
            o   foreground
 
            o   pid
 
            o   setgid
 
            o   setuid
 
            The  use  of  the  'setuid'  option  will  also prevent stunnel from
            binding to privileged (<1024) ports during configuration reloading.
 
            When the 'chroot' option is used, stunnel  will  look  for  all  its
            files  (including the configuration file, certificates, the log file
            and the pid file) within the chroot jail.
 
        SIGUSR1
            Close and reopen the stunnel log file.  This function  can  be  used
            for log rotation.
 
        SIGUSR2
            Log the list of active connections.
 
        SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT
            Shut stunnel down.
 
        The result of sending any other signals to the server is undefined.
 
 EXAMPLES
        In order to provide TLS encapsulation to your local imapd service, use:
 
            [imapd]
            accept = 993
            exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
            execArgs = imapd
 
        or in remote mode:
 
            [imapd]
            accept = 993
            connect = 143
 
        In  order to let your local e-mail client connect to a TLS-enabled imapd
        service on another server, configure the e-mail  client  to  connect  to
        localhost on port 119 and use:
 
            [imap]
            client = yes
            accept = 143
            connect = servername:993
 
        If  you  want to provide tunneling to your pppd daemon on port 2020, use
        something like:
 
            [vpn]
            accept = 2020
            exec = /usr/sbin/pppd
            execArgs = pppd local
            pty = yes
 
        If you want to use stunnel in inetd mode to launch your  imapd  process,
        you'd  use  this  stunnel.conf.   Note  there  must be no [service_name]
        section.
 
            exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
            execArgs = imapd
 
        To setup SOCKS VPN configure the following client service:
 
            [socks_client]
            client = yes
            accept = 127.0.0.1:1080
            connect = vpn_server:9080
            verifyPeer = yes
            CAfile = stunnel.pem
 
        The corresponding configuration on the vpn_server host:
 
            [socks_server]
            protocol = socks
            accept = 9080
            cert = stunnel.pem
            key = stunnel.key
 
        Now test your configuration on the client machine with:
 
            curl --socks4a localhost http://www.example.com/
 
        An example server mode SNI configuration:
 
            [virtual]
            ; primary service
            accept = 443
            cert =  default.pem
            connect = default.internal.mydomain.com:8080
 
            [sni1]
            ; secondary service 1
            sni = virtual:server1.mydomain.com
            cert = server1.pem
            connect = server1.internal.mydomain.com:8081
 
            [sni2]
            ; secondary service 2
            sni = virtual:server2.mydomain.com
            cert = server2.pem
            connect = server2.internal.mydomain.com:8082
            verifyPeer = yes
            CAfile = server2-allowed-clients.pem
 
        An example of advanced engine configuration  allows  for  authentication
        with  private  keys  stored  in  the  Windows certificate store (Windows
        only).  With the CAPI engine you  don't  need  to  manually  select  the
        client  key  to  use.  The client key is automatically selected based on
        the list of CAs trusted by the server.
 
            engine = capi
 
            [service]
            engineId = capi
            client = yes
            accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
            connect = example.com:8443
 
        An example of advanced engine configuration to use the  certificate  and
        the corresponding private key from a pkcs11 engine:
 
            engine = pkcs11
            engineCtrl = MODULE_PATH:opensc-pkcs11.so
            engineCtrl = PIN:123456
 
            [service]
            engineId = pkcs11
            client = yes
            accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
            connect = example.com:843
            cert = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyCert
            key = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyKey
 
        An  example  of advanced engine configuration to use the certificate and
        the corresponding private key from a SoftHSM token:
 
            engine = pkcs11
            engineCtrl = MODULE_PATH:softhsm2.dll
            engineCtrl = PIN:12345
 
            [service]
            engineId = pkcs11
            client = yes
            accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
            connect = example.com:843
            cert = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=KeyCert
 
        An example of advanced provider configuration to use the certificate and
        the corresponding private key from a `pkcs11prov` provider:
 
        Note: requires OpenSSL 3.0 or later
 
            setEnv = PKCS11_MODULE_PATH=opensc-pkcs11.dll
            setEnv = PKCS11_PIN:123456
            provider = pkcs11prov
 
            [service]
            client = yes
            accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
            connect = example.com:843
            cert = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyCert
            key = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyKey
 
        Note: requires OpenSSL 3.5 or later
 
            provider = pkcs11prov
            providerParameter = pkcs11prov:pkcs11_module=opensc-pkcs11.dll
            providerParameter = pkcs11prov:pin=123456
 
            [service]
            client = yes
            accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
            connect = example.com:843
            cert = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyCert
            key = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyKey
 
        On Windows, the PKCS#11 library must be  placed  in  the  `ossl-modules`
        directory,   or   a   full   absolute   path   must   be   provided   in
        `PKCS11_MODULE_PATH` or `pkcs11_module` parameter.
 
 NOTES
    RESTRICTIONS
        stunnel cannot be used for the FTP daemon because of the nature  of  the
        FTP  protocol  which  utilizes multiple ports for data transfers.  There
        are available TLS-enabled versions of FTP and telnet daemons, however.
 
    INETD MODE
        The most common use of stunnel is  to  listen  on  a  network  port  and
        establish  communication  with either a new port via the connect option,
        or a new program via the exec option.  However there is a  special  case
        when you wish to have some other program accept incoming connections and
        launch stunnel, for example with inetd, xinetd, or tcpserver.
 
        For example, if you have the following line in inetd.conf:
 
            imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/stunnel stunnel /etc/stunnel/imaps.conf
 
        In  these  cases,  the  inetd-style program is responsible for binding a
        network socket (imaps above) and handing it to stunnel when a connection
        is received.  Thus you do not want stunnel to have  any  accept  option.
        All  the  Service  Level  Options should be placed in the global options
        section, and  no  [service_name]  section  will  be  present.   See  the
        EXAMPLES section for example configurations.
 
    CERTIFICATES
        Each  TLS-enabled  daemon  needs to present a valid X.509 certificate to
        the peer. It also needs a private key to decrypt the incoming data.  The
        easiest  way  to obtain a certificate and a key is to generate them with
        the free OpenSSL package. You can find more information on  certificates
        generation on pages listed below.
 
        The  .pem  file  should contain the unencrypted private key and a signed
        certificate (not certificate request).  So the  file  should  look  like
        this:
 
            -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            [encoded key]
            -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            [encoded certificate]
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
 
    RANDOMNESS
        stunnel needs to seed the PRNG (pseudo-random number generator) in order
        for  TLS  to  use  good randomness.  The following sources are loaded in
        order until sufficient random data has been gathered:
 
        o   The file specified with the RNDfile flag.
 
        o   The file specified by the RANDFILE environment variable, if set.
 
        o   The file .rnd in your home directory, if RANDFILE not set.
 
        o   The file specified with '--with-random' at compile time.
 
        o   The contents of the screen if running on Windows.
 
        o   The egd socket specified with the EGD flag.
 
        o   The egd socket specified with '--with-egd-sock' at compile time.
 
        o   The /dev/urandom device.
 
        Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user  interaction
        (mouse  movements,  creating  windows, etc.) the screen contents are not
        variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a  random  file
        for use with the RNDfile flag.
 
        Note that the file specified with the RNDfile flag should contain random
        data  --  that  means  it should contain different information each time
        stunnel is run.  This is handled automatically unless  the  RNDoverwrite
        flag  is  used.   If  you wish to update this file manually, the openssl
        rand command in recent versions of OpenSSL, would be useful.
 
        Important note: If /dev/urandom is available, OpenSSL  often  seeds  the
        PRNG  with  it  while  checking  the  random  state.   On  systems  with
        /dev/urandom OpenSSL is likely to use it even though it is listed at the
        very bottom of the list above.  This is the behaviour of OpenSSL and not
        stunnel.
 
    DH PARAMETERS
        stunnel 4.40  and  later  contains  hardcoded  2048-bit  DH  parameters.
        Starting  with  stunnel 5.18, these hardcoded DH parameters are replaced
        every 24 hours with autogenerated temporary DH parameters.  DH parameter
        generation may take several minutes.
 
        Alternatively, it is possible to specify static  DH  parameters  in  the
        certificate file, which disables generating temporary DH parameters:
 
            openssl dhparam 2048 >> stunnel.pem
