 usage:
 ------
 
 	dc3dd [OPTION 1] [OPTION 2] ... [OPTION N]
 
 		*or*
 
 	dc3dd [HELP OPTION]
 
 	where each OPTION is selected from the basic or advanced
 	options listed below, or HELP OPTION is selected from the
 	help options listed below.
 
 --------------
 basic options:
 --------------
 
 	if=DEVICE or FILE    Read input from a device or a file (see note #1
 	                     below for how to read from standard input). This
 	                     option can only be used once and cannot be
 	                     combined with ifs=, pat=, or tpat=.
 	ifs=BASE.FMT         Read input from a set of files with base name
 	                     BASE and sequential file name extensions
 	                     conforming to the format specifier FMT (see note
 	                     #4 below for how to specify FMT). This option
 	                     can only be used once and cannot be combined with
 	                     if=, pat=, or tpat=.
 	of=FILE or DEVICE    Write output to a file or device (see note #2
 	                     below for how to write to standard output). This
 	                     option can be used more than once (see note #3
 	                     below for how to generate multiple outputs).
 	hof=FILE or DEVICE   Write output to a file or device, hash the
 	                     output bytes, and verify by comparing the output
 	                     hash(es) to the input hash(es). This option can
 	                     be used more than once (see note #3 below for
 	                     how to generate multiple outputs).
 	ofs=BASE.FMT         Write output to a set of files with base name BASE
 	                     and sequential file name extensions generated from
 	                     the format specifier FMT (see note #4 below for
 	                     how to specify FMT). This option can be used more
 	                     than once (see note #3 below for how to generate
 	                     multiple outputs). Specify the maximum size of
 	                     each file in the set using ofsz=.
 	hofs=BASE.FMT        Write output to a set of files with base name BASE
 	                     and sequential file name extensions generated from
 	                     the format specifier FMT (see note #4 below for
 	                     how to specify FMT). Hash the output files and
 	                     verify by comparing the output hash(es) to the
 	                     input hash(es). This option can be used more than
 	                     once (see note #3 below for how to generate
 	                     multiple outputs). Specify the maximum size of
 	                     each file in the set using ofsz=.
 	ofsz=BYTES           Set the maximum size of each file in the sets of
 	                     files specified using ofs= or hofs= to
 	                     BYTES (see note #5 below). A default value for
 	                     this option may be set at compile time using
 	                     -DDEFAULT_OUTPUT_FILE_SIZE followed by the desired
 	                     value in BYTES.
 	hash=ALGORITHM       Compute an ALGORITHM hash of the input and also
 	                     of any outputs specified using hof=, hofs=,
 	                     or fhod=, where ALGORITHM is one of md5, sha1,
 	                     sha256, or sha512. This option may be used once
 	                     for each supported ALGORITHM. Alternatively,
 	                     hashing can be activated at compile time using one
 	                     or more of -DDEFAULT_HASH_MD5,-DDEFAULT_HASH_SHA1,
 	                     -DDEFAULT_HASH_SHA256, and -DDEFAULT_HASH_SHA512.
 	log=FILE             Log I/O statistcs, diagnostics, and total hashes
 	                     of input and output to FILE. If hlog= is not
 	                     specified, piecewise hashes of multiple file
 	                     input and output are also logged to FILE. This
 	                     option can be used more than once to generate
 	                     multiple logs.
 	hlog=FILE            Log total hashes and piecewise hashes to FILE.
 	                     This option can be used more than once to generate
 	                     multiple logs.
 	mlog=FILE            Create hash log that is easier for machine to read
 
 -----------------
 advanced options:
 -----------------
 
 	fhod=DEVICE          The same as hof=DEVICE, with additional
 	                     hashing of the entire output DEVICE. This option
 	                     can be used more than once (see note #3 below
 	                     for how to generate multiple outputs).
 	rec=off              By default, zeros are written to the output(s) in
 	                     place of bad sectors when the input is a device.
 	                     Use this option to cause the program to instead
 	                     exit when a bad sector is encountered.
 	wipe=DEVICE          Wipe DEVICE by writing zeros (default) or a
 	                     pattern specified by pat= or tpat=.
 	hwipe=DEVICE         Wipe DEVICE by writing zeros (default) or a
 	                     pattern specified by pat= or tpat=. Verify
 	                     DEVICE after writing it by hashing it and
 	                     comparing the hash(es) to the input hash(es).
 	pat=HEX              Use pattern as input, writing HEX to every byte
 	                     of the output. This option can only be used once
 	                     and cannot be combined with if=, ifs=, or
 	                     tpat=.
 	tpat=TEXT            Use text pattern as input, writing the string TEXT
 	                     repeatedly to the output. This option can only be
 	                     used once and cannot be combined with if=, ifs=,
 	                     or pat=.
 	cnt=SECTORS          Read only SECTORS input sectors. Must be used
 	                     with pat= or tpat= if not using the pattern with
 	                     wipe= or hwipe= to wipe a device.
 	iskip=SECTORS        Skip SECTORS sectors at start of the input device
 	                     or file.
 	oskip=SECTORS        Skip SECTORS sectors at start of the output
 	                     file. Specifying oskip= automatically 
 	                     sets app=on.
 	app=on               Do not overwrite an output file specified with
 	                     of= if it already exists, appending output instead.
 	ssz=BYTES            Unconditionally use BYTES (see note #5 below) bytes
 	                     for sector size. If ssz= is not specified,
 	                     sector size is determined by probing the device;
 	                     if the probe fails or the target is not a device,
 	                     a sector size of 512 bytes is assumed.
 	bufsz=BYTES          Set the size of the internal byte buffers to BYTES
 	                     (see note #5 below). This effectively sets the
 	                     maximum number of bytes that may be read at a time
 	                     from the input. BYTES must be a multiple of sector
 	                     size. Use this option to fine-tune performance.
 	verb=on              Activate verbose reporting, where sectors in/out
 	                     are reported for each file in sets of files
 	                     specified using ifs=, ofs=, or hofs=.
 	                     Alternatively, verbose reporting may be activated
 	                     at compile time using -DDEFAULT_VERBOSE_REPORTING.
 	nwspc=on             Activate compact reporting, where the use
 	                     of white space to divide log output into
 	                     logical sections is suppressed. Alternatively,
 	                     compact reporting may be activated at compile
 	                     time using -DDEFAULT_COMPACT_REPORTING.
 	b10=on               Activate base 10 bytes reporting, where the
 	                     progress display reports 1000 bytes instead
 	                     of 1024 bytes as 1 KB. Alternatively, base 10
 	                     bytes reporting may be activated at compile
 	                     time using -DDEFAULT_BASE_TEN_BYTES_REPORTING.
 	corruptoutput=on     For verification testing and demonstration
 	                     purposes, corrupt the output file(s) with extra
 	                     bytes so a hash mismatch is guaranteed.

 help options:
 -------------
 
       --help     display this help and exit
       --version  output version information and exit
       --flags    display compile-time flags and exit
 
 ------
 notes:
 ------
 
 1. To read from stdin, do not specify if=, ifs=, pat=, or tpat=.
 2. To write to stdout, do not specify of=, hof=, ofs=, hofs=, fhod=,
    wipe=, or hwipe=.
 3. To write to multiple outputs specify more than one of of=, hof=, ofs=,
    hofs=, or fhod=, in any combination.
 4. FMT is a pattern for a sequence of file extensions that can be numerical
    starting at zero, numerical starting at one, or alphabetical. Specify FMT
    by using a series of zeros, ones, or a's, respectively. The number of
    characters used indicates the desired length of the extensions.
    For example, a FMT specifier of 0000 indicates four character
    numerical extensions starting with 0000.
 5. BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
    c (1), w (2), b (512), kB (1000), K (1024), MB (1000*1000),
    M (1024*1024), GB (1000*1000*1000), G (1024*1024*1024), and
    so on for T, P, E, Z, and Y.
 6. Consider using cnt=, iskip= and oskip= to work around
    unreadable sectors if error recovery fails.
 7. Sending an interrupt (e.g., CTRL+C) to dc3dd will cause
    the program to report the work completed at the time
    the interrupt is received and then exit.

## dc3dd Usage Example

Write a binary image from the source (`if=/var/log/messages`) to the destination (`of=/tmp/dc3dd`) and calculate the SHA512 sum (`hash=sha512`):

```console
root@kali:~# dc3dd if=/var/log/messages of=/tmp/dc3dd hash=sha512

dc3dd 7.2.646 started at 2018-12-01 13:37:20 -0500
compiled options:
command line: dc3dd if=/var/log/messages of=/tmp/dc3dd hash=sha512
sector size: 512 bytes (assumed)
    42015925 bytes ( 40 M ) copied ( 100% ),    0 s, 185 M/s

input results for file `/var/log/messages':
   82062 sectors + 181 bytes in
   2dd19a4fd6bdebddf2ce754f4b09f7914b7cb7433efc5b8678ff437d9e13857995815c2b63ae4722a6d4c143347458497fb6b1b4a1ef4e4fd3c5d9cd08111f16 (sha512)

output results for file `/tmp/dc3dd':
   82062 sectors + 181 bytes out
