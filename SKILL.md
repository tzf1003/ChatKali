# Kali Linux Tools

This skill provides a comprehensive reference for Kali Linux tools, organized by category and backed by the official Kali tools documentation repository.

## Routing

**Lookup order (strict):**
1. Open this `SKILL.md` and locate a category.
2. Open the category index in `references/uncategorized.md`.
3. From the category, open a tool page in `references/tools/nmap.md`.

Notes:
- A tool can belong to **multiple categories**.
- Tool pages always list their categories and link back.
